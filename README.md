# dislike-button
If I had a penny for every client who wants a like button for his website but would probably need a dislike button even moreâ€¦

This is a simple dislike button plugin for Wordpress.

Copy the folder to your /wp_content/plugins folder, activate the plugin in the Wordpress backend and include the PHP snippet `<?php dislike_button(); ?>` where the button should appear in your theme.

So far, this was only roughly tested well after midnight. Please let me know about any bugs!
